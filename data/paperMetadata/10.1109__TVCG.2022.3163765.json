  "title": "A Model for Types and Levels of Automation in Visual Analytics: a Survey, a Taxonomy, and Examples",
  "abstract": "The continuous growth in availability and access to data presents a major challenge to the human analyst. As the manual analysis of large and complex datasets is nowadays practically impossible, the need for assisting tools that can automate the analysis process while keeping the human analyst in the loop is imperative. A large and growing body of literature recognizes the crucial role of automation in Visual Analytics and suggests that automation is among the most important constituents for effective Visual Analytics systems. Today, however, there is no appropriate taxonomy nor terminology for assessing the extent of automation in a Visual Analytics system. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by introducing a model of levels of automation tailored for the Visual Analytics domain. The consistent terminology of the proposed taxonomy could provide a ground for users/readers/reviewers to describe and compare automation in Visual Analytics systems. Our taxonomy is grounded on a combination of several existing and well-established taxonomies of levels of automation in the human-machine interaction domain and relevant models within the visual analytics field. To exemplify the proposed taxonomy, we selected a set of existing systems from the event-sequence analytics domain and mapped the automation of their visual analytics process stages against the automation levels in our taxonomy.",
