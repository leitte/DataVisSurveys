  "title": "Visual programming, programming by example, and program visualization: a taxonomy",
  "abstract": "There has been a great interest recently in systems that use graphics to aid in the programming, debugging, and understanding of computer programs. The terms \u201cVisual Programming\u201d and \u201cProgram Visualization\u201d have been applied to these systems. Also, there has been a renewed interest in using examples to help alleviate the complexity of programming. This technique is called \u201cProgramming by Example.\u201d This paper attempts to provide more meaning to these terms by giving precise definitions, and then uses these definitions to classify existing systems into a taxonomy. A number of common unsolved problems with most of these systems are also listed.",
