  "title": "Visual Cue Based Corrective Feedback for Motor Skill Training in Mixed Reality: A Survey",
  "abstract": "When learning a motor skill it is helpful to get corrective feedback from an instructor. This will support the learner to execute the movement correctly. With modern technology, it is possible to provide this feedback via mixed reality. In most cases, this involves visual cues to help the user understand the corrective feedback. We analyzed recent research approaches utilizing visual cues for feedback in mixed reality. The scope of this article is visual feedback for motor skill learning, which involves physical therapy, exercise, rehabilitation etc. While some of the surveyed literature discusses therapeutic effects of the training, this article focuses on visualization techniques. We categorized the literature from a visualization standpoint, including visual cues, technology and characteristics of the feedback. This provided insights into how visual feedback in mixed reality is applied in the literature and how different aspects of the feedback are related. The insights obtained can help to better adjust future feedback systems to the target group and their needs. This article also provides a deeper understanding of the characteristics of the visual cues in general and promotes future, more detailed research on this topic.",
