  "title": "Geometric Detection Algorithms for Cavities on Protein Surfaces in Molecular Graphics: A Survey",
  "abstract": "Detecting and analysing protein cavities provides significant information about active sites for biological processes (e.g. protein\u2013protein or protein\u2013ligand binding) in molecular graphics and modelling. Using the three\u2010dimensional (3D) structure of a given protein (i.e. atom types and their locations in 3D) as retrieved from a PDB (Protein Data Bank) file, it is now computationally viable to determine a description of these cavities. Such cavities correspond to pockets, clefts, invaginations, voids, tunnels, channels and grooves on the surface of a given protein. In this work, we survey the literature on protein cavity computation and classify algorithmic approaches into three categories: evolution\u2010based, energy\u2010based and geometry\u2010based. Our survey focuses on geometric algorithms, whose taxonomy is extended to include not only sphere\u2010, grid\u2010 and tessellation\u2010based methods, but also surface\u2010based, hybrid geometric, consensus and time\u2010varying methods. Finally, we detail those techniques that have been customized for GPU (graphics processing unit) computing.",
