  "title": "Interactive High-Dimensional Data Visualization",
  "abstract": "Abstract We propose a rudimentary taxonomy of interactive data visualization based on a triad of data analytic tasks: finding Gestalt, posing queries, and making comparisons. These tasks are supported by three classes of interactive view manipulations: focusing, linking, and arranging views. This discussion extends earlier work on the principles of focusing and linking and sets them on a firmer base. Next, we give a high-level introduction to a particular system for multivariate data visualization\u2014XGobi. This introduction is not comprehensive but emphasizes XGobi tools that are examples of focusing, linking, and arranging views; namely, high-dimensional projections, linked scatterplot brushing, and matrices of conditional plots. Finally, in a series of case studies in data visualization, we show the powers and limitations of particular focusing, linking, and arranging tools. The discussion is dominated by high-dimensional projections that form an extremely well-developed part of XGobi. Of particular inter...",
