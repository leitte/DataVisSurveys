  "title": "Top 10 Unsolved Information Visualization Problems",
  "abstract": "The top 10 unsolved problems list described in this article is a revised and extended version of information visualization problems. These problems are not necessarily imposed by technical barriers, rather, they are problems that might hinder the growth of information visualization as a field. The first three problems highlight issues from a user-centered perspective. The fifth, sixth, and seventh problems are technical challenges in nature. The last three are the ones that need tackling at the disciplinary level. The author broadly defines information visualization as visual representations of the semantics, or meaning, of information. In contrast to scientific visualization, information visualization typically deals with nonnumeric, nonspatial, and high-dimensional data.",
