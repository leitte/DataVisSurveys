The objective of colour mapping or colour transfer methods is to recolour a given image or video by deriving a mapping between that image and another image serving as a reference. These methods have received considerable attention in recent years, both in academic literature and industrial applications. Methods for recolouring images have often appeared under the labels of colour correction, colour transfer or colour balancing, to name a few, but their goal is always the same: mapping the colours of one image to another. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of these methods and offer a classification of current solutions depending not only on their algorithmic formulation but also their range of applications. We also provide a new dataset and a novel evaluation technique called ‘evaluation by colour mapping roundtrip’. We discuss the relative merit of each class of techniques through examples and show how colour mapping solutions can have been applied to a diverse range of problems.
