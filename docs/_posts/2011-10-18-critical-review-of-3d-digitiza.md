This article concentrates on the epistemological aspects of architectural survey. It offers a critical observationof the technologies used in the field of 3D digitization. More specifically, the study evaluates the way in whichthe tools and methods used for the acquisition and representation of the data do or do not contribute to theenhancement of architectural knowledge. To understand the relationships between technology and knowledgetransfer, we will carry out an observation based on a series of case studies. This is intended to highlight a dual issueof a cognitive nature: the first, perceptual, refers to the comprehension of the object and the second, descriptive,refers to the intelligibility of the 3D information model. This reflexive approach is justified by the fact that the maintechnological advances rarely compensate the methodological deficiencies encountered. Finally, this article offersperspectives for the in-depth study of all the cognitive mechanisms involved in the architectural survey.
