Visualization methods are commonly used during the successive stages of the archaeological process. However, it is difficult to determine which methods are more intensively used in each stage and, also, which stage of the archaeological process is more demanding regarding visualization needs. Within a broader questionnaire regarding the use of computer tools, archaeologists were inquired about their use of traditional and computer-based visualization methods during the different stages of the archaeological process. The main survey results concerning visualization methods are presented and briefly analyzed.
