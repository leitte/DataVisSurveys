How we as insiders see and understand InfoVis is quite different from how it is seen by most people in the world out there. Most people get only glimpses of what we do, and those glimpses rarely tell the story clearly. Think about the view of InfoVis that has been created in 2007 through marketing, blogs, and articles. This view is peppered with misperception.

The world needs what we do, but this need remains largely unsatisfied.
