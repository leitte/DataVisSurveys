Software visualization means visualizing various aspects and artifacts related to software. By this definition a wide range of different software engineering aspects from program comprehension to understanding software process and usage are covered. This paper presents the results of systematic literature review spanning six years of software visualization literature. The main result shows that the most studied topics in the past six years are related to software structure, behavior and evolution. Software process and usage are addressed only in few studies. In the future studying the adoption of software visualization tools in industry context would be beneficial.
