Performance visualization comprises techniques that aid developers and analysts in improving the time and energy efficiency of their software. In this work, we discuss performance as it relates to visualization and survey existing approaches in performance visualization. We present an overview of what types of performance data can be collected and a categorization of the types of goals that performance visualization techniques can address. We develop a taxonomy for the contexts in which different performance visualizations reside and describe the state of the art research pertaining to each. Finally, we discuss unaddressed and future challenges in performance visualization.
