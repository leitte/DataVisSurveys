Public opinion surveys constitute a widespread, powerful tool to study peoples’ attitudes and behaviors from comparative perspectives. However, even global surveys can have limited geographic and temporal coverage, which can hinder the production of comprehensive knowledge. To expand the scope of comparison, social scientists turn to ex-post harmonization of variables from datasets that cover similar topics but in different populations and/or at different times. These harmonized datasets can be analyzed as a single source and accessed through various data portals. However, the Survey Data Recycling (SDR) research project has identified three challenges faced by social scientists when using data portals: the lack of capability to explore data in-depth or query data based on customized needs, the difficulty in efficiently identifying related data for studies, and the incapability to evaluate theoretical models using sliced data. To address these issues, the SDR research project has developed the SDRQuerier, which is applied to the harmonized SDR database. The SDRQuerier includes a BERT-based model that allows for customized data queries through research questions or keywords (Query-by-Question), a visual design that helps users determine the availability of harmonized data for a given research question (Query-by-Condition), and the ability to reveal the underlying relational patterns among substantive and methodological variables in the database (Query-by-Relation), aiding in the rigorous evaluation or improvement of regression models. Case studies with multiple social scientists have demonstrated the usefulness and effectiveness of the SDRQuerier in addressing daily challenges.
