Data-driven intelligent transportation systems utilize data resources generated within intelligent systems to improve the performance of transportation systems and provide convenient and reliable services. Traffic data refer to datasets generated and collected on moving vehicles and objects. Data visualization is an efficient means to represent distributions and structures of datasets and reveal hidden patterns in the data. This paper introduces the basic concept and pipeline of traffic data visualization, provides an overview of related data processing techniques, and summarizes existing methods for depicting the temporal, spatial, numerical, and categorical properties of traffic data.
