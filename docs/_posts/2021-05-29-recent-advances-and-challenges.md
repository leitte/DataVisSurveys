With data comes uncertainty, which is a widespread and frequent phenomenon in data science and analysis. The amount of information available to us is growing exponentially, owing to never-ending technological advancements. Data visualization is one of the ways to convey that information effectively. Since the error is intrinsic to data, users cannot ignore it in visualization. Failing to observe it in visualization can lead to flawed decision-making by data analysts. Data scientists know that missing out on uncertainty in data visualization can lead to misleading conclusions about data accuracy. In most cases, visualization approaches assume that the information represented is free from any error or unreliability; however, this is rarely true. The goal of uncertainty visualization is to minimize the errors in judgment and represent the information as accurately as possible. This survey discusses state-of-the-art approaches to uncertainty visualization, along with the concept of uncertainty and its sources. From the study of uncertainty visualization literature, we identified popular techniques accompanied by their merits and shortcomings. We also briefly discuss several uncertainty visualization evaluation strategies. Finally, we present possible future research directions in uncertainty visualization, along with the conclusion.
