There exists a gulf between the rhetoric in visualisation research about the significance of uncertainty and the inclusion of representations of uncertainty in visualisations used in practice. The graphical representation of uncertainty information has emerged as a problem of great importance in visualisation research. This contribution presents a survey of 286 uncertainty visualisation research publications. All publications are categorised with regard to publication type, publication venue, application domain, target user, and evaluation type. We present an interactive web-based browser that facilitates easy visual search and exploration of the publications included in the survey. We conclude that uncertainty visualisation is severely limited by the quality and scope of uncertainty data, by the limited confidence in the data, and by the perceptual and cognitive confusion that the graphical representation of the data can generate.
