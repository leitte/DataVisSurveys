This paper presents the state of the art in the area of topology‐based visualization. It describes the process and results of an extensive annotation for generating a definition and terminology for the field. The terminology enabled a typology for topological models which is used to organize research results and the state of the art. Our report discusses relations among topological models and for each model describes research results for the computation, simplification, visualization, and application. The paper identifies themes common to subfields, current frontiers, and unexplored territory in this research area.
