The area of coordinated and multiple views has been steadily developing and maturing over the past fifteen years. Some may say that it is a "solved problem', while others argue that we are only just scratching the surface of the subject. Considering merely the CMV conference series, it is clear to see that in the early years researchers were concerned with models and techniques, while in latter years authors presented more work on how to apply these ideas to different domains. It is our view that there is still much research to be done, but the subject is changing and developing as a tool for visual analytics. This paper provides the "state of the art' of CMV, it describes areas that should be developed further and looks at what the future may hold for coordinated and multiple views.
