Comprehending software clones is necessary for a number of activities in software development. The comprehension of software clones is challenged by the sheer volume of data and the complexity of the information content in that data. Visualization, or visual data analysis, takes advantage of human cognitive skills to discover unstructured insights from the visual presentations of complex and voluminous data. In this paper, we survey the existing literature on visualization of software clones. We gather the insights provided, and put that information in context of actual information needs systematically derived from the clone management goals. This framework allows us to better understand the role a visualization may play in achieving a specific user goal, identify potential gaps between existing types of visualization and information needs, and find complementary non-redundant subsets of visualizations for each user goal.
