We present a state‐of‐the‐art report on time‐dependent flow topology. We survey representative papers in visualization and provide a taxonomy of existing approaches that generalize flow topology from time‐independent to time‐dependent settings. The approaches are classified based upon four categories: tracking of steady topology, reference frame adaption, pathline classification or clustering, and generalization of critical points. Our unique contributions include introducing a set of desirable mathematical properties to interpret physical meaningfulness for time‐dependent flow visualization, inferring mathematical properties associated with selective research papers, and utilizing such properties for classification. The five most important properties identified in the existing literature include coincidence with the steady case, induction of a partition within the domain, Lagrangian invariance, objectivity, and Galilean invariance.
