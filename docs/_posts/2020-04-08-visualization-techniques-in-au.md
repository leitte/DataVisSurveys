In recent years, the development of Augmented Reality (AR) frameworks made AR application development widely accessible to developers without AR expert background. With this development, new application fields for AR are on the rise. This comes with an increased need for visualization techniques that are suitable for a wide range of application areas. It becomes more important for a wider audience to gain a better understanding of existing AR visualization techniques. In this article we provide a taxonomy of existing works on visualization techniques in AR. The taxonomy aims to give researchers and developers without an in-depth background in Augmented Reality the information to successively apply visualization techniques in Augmented Reality environments. We also describe required components and methods and analyze common patterns.
