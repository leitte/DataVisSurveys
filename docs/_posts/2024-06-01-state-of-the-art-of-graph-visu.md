Visualizing graphs and networks in non‐Euclidean space can have benefits such as natural focus+context in hyperbolic space and the familiarity of interactions in spherical space. Despite work on these topics going back to the mid 1990s, there is no survey, or a part of a survey for this area of research. In this paper we review and categorize over 60 relevant papers and analyze them by geometry, (e.g., spherical, hyperbolic, torus), by contribution (e.g., technique, evaluation, proof, application), and by graph class (e.g., tree, planar, complex).
