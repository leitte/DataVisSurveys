Before seeing a patient for the first time, healthcare workers will typically conduct a comprehensive clinical chart review of the patient's electronic health record (EHR). Within the diverse documentation pieces included there, text notes are among the most important and thoroughly perused segments for this task; and yet they are among the least supported medium in terms of content navigation and overview. In this work, we delve deeper into the task of clinical chart review from a data visualization perspective and propose a hybrid graphics+text approach via ChartWalk, an interactive tool to support the review of text notes in EHRs. We report on our iterative design process grounded in input provided by a diverse range of healthcare professionals, with steps including: (a) initial requirements distilled from interviews and the literature, (b) an interim evaluation to validate design decisions, and (c) a task-based qualitative evaluation of our final design. We contribute lessons learned to better support the design of tools not only for clinical chart reviews but also other healthcare-related tasks around medical text analysis.
