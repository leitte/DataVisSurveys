Visual Analytics (VA) aims to combine the strengths of humans and computers for effective data analysis. In this endeavor, humansâ€™ tacit knowledge from prior experience is an important asset that can be leveraged by both human and computer to improve the analytic process. While VA environments are starting to include features to formalize, store, and utilize such knowledge, the mechanisms and degree in which these environments integrate explicit knowledge varies widely. Additionally, this important class of VA environments has never been elaborated on by existing work on VA theory. This paper proposes a conceptual model of Knowledge-assisted VA conceptually grounded on the visualization model by van Wijk. We apply the model to describe various examples of knowledge-assisted VA from the literature and elaborate on three of them in finer detail. Moreover, we illustrate the utilization of the model to compare different design alternatives and to evaluate existing approaches with respect to their use of knowledge. Finally, the model can inspire designers to generate novel VA environments using explicit knowledge effectively.
