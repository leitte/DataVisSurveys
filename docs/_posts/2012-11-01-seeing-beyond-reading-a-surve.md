We review recent visualization techniques aimed at supporting tasks that require the analysis of text documents, from approaches targeted at visually summarizing the relevant content of a single document to those aimed at assisting exploratory investigation of whole collections of documents.Techniques are organized considering their target input material—either single texts or collections of texts—and their focus, which may be at displaying content, emphasizing relevant relationships, highlighting the temporal evolution of a document or collection, or helping users to handle results from a query posed to a search engine.We describe the approaches adopted by distinct techniques and briefly review the strategies they employ to obtain meaningful text models, discuss how they extract the information required to produce representative visualizations, the tasks they intend to support and the interaction issues involved, and strengths and limitations. Finally, we show a summary of techniques, highlighting their goals and distinguishing characteristics. We also briefly discuss some open problems and research directions in the fields of visual text mining and text analytics. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
