Volume rendering techniques have been developed for decades and have been widely applied in many research fields, such as medical image visualization, geological exploration, scientific computing. etc. With the maturity of volume visualization techniques, one may have many choices to analyze volume data. However, facing different application requirements in specific cases, one may need pertinent methods to visualize volume data and highlight specific volume features. In this paper, we review and classify the existing literature on feature enhancement volume rendering. The classification is conducted based on the enhancement of four types of features (the external feature, the internal feature, the structure feature, and the ideographic feature) in volume data. Finally, we conclude this survey with future challenges in feature enhancement volume visualization.
