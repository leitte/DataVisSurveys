Information visualizations such as bar charts and line charts are very common for analyzing data and discovering critical insights. Often people analyze charts to answer questions that they have in mind. Answering such questions can be challenging as they often require a significant amount of perceptual and cognitive effort. Chart Question Answering (CQA) systems typically take a chart and a natural language question as input and automatically generate the answer to facilitate visual data analysis. Over the last few years, there has been a growing body of literature on the task of CQA. In this survey, we systematically review the current state‐of‐the‐art research focusing on the problem of chart question answering. We provide a taxonomy by identifying several important dimensions of the problem domain including possible inputs and outputs of the task and discuss the advantages and limitations of proposed solutions. We then summarize various evaluation techniques used in the surveyed papers. Finally, we outline the open challenges and future research opportunities related to chart question answering.
