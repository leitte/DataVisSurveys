Information and Communication Technology (ICT) applications have become increasingly widespread, driven by the increasing demands of visitors for more tools for interpretation and entertainment and the need of heritage professionals to diversify the cultural offer. Museums' objectives for technology investment can differ greatly around the world, influencing the type of technology used and the mechanisms of visitors' engagement. This paper presents the results of a survey conducted on a selected sample of museums in Japan to assess the type of ICT deployed and understand their strategic rationale for technology investment. The methodology adopted combined participant observation, interview with museums' curators and managers as well as a questionnaire modelled on the Holistic Heritage Impact Training Model, developed by the CUBIST Research Group at the University of Brighton Business School. This survey is a preliminary analysis for the future design and development of an interactive ICT application to display the stories depicted on two by≈çbu (Japanese traditional wooden folding screens) displayed at Osaka Castle Museum.
