The detailed underwater bathymetric data provided by Sonar Research and Development's high speed multi-frequency sonar transducer system provides new challenges in the development of interactive seabed visualization tools. The paper introduces a "Whole Field Modelling" system developed at Sonar Research and Development Ltd and The Department of Computer Science, University of Hull. This system provides the viewer with a new 3D underwater visualization environment that allows the user to pilot a virtual underwater vehicle around an accurate seabed model. We consider two example case studies that use the Whole Field Modelling system for visualizing sonar data. Both case studies, visualizing real time pipeline dredging and pipe restoration visualization, are implemented using real survey data.
