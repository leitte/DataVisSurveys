How can we help domain-knowledgeable users who do not have expertise in AI analyze why an AI agent failed? Our research team previously developed a new structured process for such users to assess AI, called After-Action Review for AI (AAR/AI), consisting of a series of steps a human takes to assess an AI agent and formalize their understanding. In this paper, we investigate how the AAR/AI process can scale up to support reinforcement learning (RL) agents that operate in complex environments. We augment the AAR/AI process to be performed at three levels—episode-level, decision-level, and explanation-level—and integrate it into our redesigned visual analytics interface. We illustrate our approach through a usage scenario of analyzing why a RL agent lost in a complex real-time strategy game built with the StarCraft 2 engine. We believe integrating structured processes like AAR/AI into visualization tools can help visualization play a more critical role in AI interpretability.
