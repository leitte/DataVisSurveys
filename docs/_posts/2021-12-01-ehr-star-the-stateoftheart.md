Since the inception of electronic health records (EHR) and population health records (PopHR), the volume of archived digital health records is growing rapidly. Large volumes of heterogeneous health records require advanced visualization and visual analytics systems to uncover valuable insight buried in complex databases. As a vibrant sub‐field of information visualization and visual analytics, many interactive EHR and PopHR visualization (EHR Vis) systems have been proposed, developed, and evaluated by clinicians to support effective clinical analysis and decision making. We present the state‐of‐the‐art (STAR) of EHR Vis literature and open access healthcare data sources and provide an up‐to‐date overview on this important topic. We identify trends and challenges in the field, introduce novel literature and data classifications, and incorporate a popular medical terminology standard called the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). We provide a curated list of electronic and population healthcare data sources and open access datasets as a resource for potential researchers, in order to address one of the main challenges in this field. We classify the literature based on multidisciplinary research themes stemming from reoccurring topics. The survey provides a valuable overview of EHR Vis revealing both mature areas and potential future multidisciplinary research directions.
