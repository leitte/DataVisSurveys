The field of smooth vector graphics explores the representation, creation, rasterization, and automatic generation of light-weight image representations, frequently used for scalable image content. Over the past decades, several conceptual approaches on the representation of images with smooth gradients have emerged that each led to separate research threads, including the popular gradient meshes and diffusion curves. As the computational models matured, the mathematical descriptions diverged and article started to focus more narrowly on subproblems, such as on the representation and creation of vector graphics, or the automatic vectorization from raster images. Most of the work concentrated on a specific mathematical model only. With this survey, we describe the established computational models in a consistent notation to spur further knowledge transfer, leveraging the recent advances in each field. We therefore categorize vector graphics article from the last decades based on their underlying mathematical representations as well as on their contribution to the vector graphics content creation pipeline, comprising representation, creation, rasterization, and automatic image vectorization. This survey is meant as an entry point for both artists and researchers. We conclude this survey with an outlook on promising research directions and challenges to overcome in the future.
