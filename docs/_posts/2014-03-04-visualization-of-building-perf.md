Performance attributes such as energy use or natural ventilation are becoming rapidly more important in the design of modern buildings. As a basis for the improvement of existing visualization techniques in this application domain, we provide a detailed tasks and requirements analysis using feedback from an architect. State-of-the-art visualization strategies used for building performance simulation results are then evaluated by comparing them to the quality aspects derived before. This assessment specifically reveals shortcomings with respect to the applied techniques for visualizing spatiotemporal data. Therefore, we discuss the potential of utilizing other visualization techniques to meet the identified prerequisites and reveal future directions based on these findings.
