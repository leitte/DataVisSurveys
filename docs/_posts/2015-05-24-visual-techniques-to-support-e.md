Recently, much research has focused on developing techniques for the visual representation of temporal graph data. This paper takes a wider look at the visual techniques involved in exploratory analysis of such data, considering the variety of sub tasks and contextual tasks required to understand change in a graph over time, and the visual techniques which are able to support these tasks. In so doing, we highlight a number of tasks which are less well supported by existing techniques, which could prove worthwhile avenues for future research.
